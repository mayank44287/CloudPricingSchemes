In this report we document our efforts in exploring simple pricing schemes in the context
of different resource types. In most cloud pricing scenarios, users present themselves
with jobs which have preferences over resource types, and we intend to find what the
effects on revenue and welfare are in the case where resources are priced in a “simple”
way as opposed to a setting where each job has a different price for each quantity of the
resource. The idea is to have strong welfare and revenue guarantees, which reasonably
justify foregoing complex pricing mechanisms. We examine the accumulated welfare
and revenue for both types of pricing techniques and consider a stochastic model for
jobs coming in with different prices. We intend to find if simple pricing schemes work in
this context. The results are inconclusive as to whether simple mechanisms are
bounded in this context.
